# Toggle Component and Style

Adds a command to quickly switch between a React component and its style. If a class name is highlighted, it will create the associated style if necessary, and navigate to that class in the stylesheet.

## Installation

For the best experience, bind a keyboard shortcut for `Toggle Component and Style` to `cmd+r`.
